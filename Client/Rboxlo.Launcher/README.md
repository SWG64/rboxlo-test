# Rboxlo.Launcher
Handles all launching of the *client*, meaning both Studio and Player Rboxlo applications. This acts as a middleman to handle communication properly from the website to the client. There is no direct website -> client communication, making integration with new clients much more easier. Fully modular.

Also makes breakfast.
